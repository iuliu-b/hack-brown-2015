All functionality is scripted in the .js file.

Gritty details:

On button press: First, an array is selected to act as a template. Such an array has blank spaces demarcated by "noun*", "adj*", etc. 
When such a marker is reached, a word from the corresponding part of speech array (generated from .txt files) is randomly chosen 
to fill the blank. When all blanks are filled, the strings are concatenated into a sentence and displayed.
